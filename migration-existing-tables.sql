-- ===============================================
-- DATACRM - SPECIFIC MIGRATION FOR EXISTING TABLES
-- All main tables exist and need safe migration
-- Version: 2.0
-- Date: 2025-07-31
-- ===============================================

-- STEP 1: Check current data counts before migration
SELECT 
    'Before Migration - Data Count Overview' as status,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM customers) as customers_count,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM users) as users_count,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM organizations) as organizations_count;

-- STEP 2: Create backup tables with current data
CREATE TABLE customers_backup_20250731 AS SELECT * FROM customers;
CREATE TABLE users_backup_20250731 AS SELECT * FROM users;
CREATE TABLE organizations_backup_20250731 AS SELECT * FROM organizations;

-- STEP 3: Show backup confirmation
SELECT 
    'Backup Created Successfully' as status,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM customers_backup_20250731) as customers_backup_count,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM users_backup_20250731) as users_backup_count,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM organizations_backup_20250731) as organizations_backup_count;

-- STEP 4: Disable Row Level Security temporarily (if enabled)
ALTER TABLE customers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; 
ALTER TABLE organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 5: Drop foreign key constraints and dependent objects
-- First, drop any views that depend on these tables
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_overview CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_overview CASCADE;

-- Drop triggers (if they exist)
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_customers_updated_at ON customers;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_users_updated_at ON users;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_organizations_updated_at ON organizations;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS set_customer_number_trigger ON customers;

-- Drop functions (if they exist)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_updated_at_column() CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS generate_customer_number(UUID) CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS set_customer_number() CASCADE;

-- STEP 6: Drop existing tables in correct order (foreign key dependencies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_activities CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_contacts CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS organizations CASCADE;

-- STEP 7: Confirmation that old tables are dropped
SELECT 'Old tables dropped successfully. Ready for new schema.' as migration_status;

-- ===============================================
-- STEP 8: NOW RUN THE NEW SCHEMA
-- Copy and paste the ENTIRE content of database-schema-comprehensive.sql
-- OR run it as a separate script after this migration
-- ===============================================

-- AFTER you've run the new schema, continue with STEP 9 below...

-- ===============================================
-- STEP 9: DATA MIGRATION (Run AFTER new schema is created)
